# CNN-config-optimizer
Manual CNN configuration is time consuming and requires expertise. This is an automated optimizer using CSA (clonal Search algorithm) and then improved with the HSA (harmony search algorithm) 
Key achievements: 97-99% test accuracy (emnist digits) 
Automated hyperparameter tuning for CNNs(number of layers, learnng rate, activation functions etc) 
Programming language: Python 
key libraries: PyTorch, numpy
